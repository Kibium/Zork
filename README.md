# Zork
Prova d'acc√©s Master

Note: To open the game, open "Zork", open "x64", open "Release", open "Zork.exe"

This game has been made as a test for entering the Advanced Programming for AAA videogames.
It consists of 2 phases:

1: Defining the world and the player's name
2: Explore the world

The World has 6 connected rooms, which are:
Cave, Corridor, Sanctuary, Stairs, Platform and Outside.

To finish the game, the player has to get to the Outside room.

To do so, the player has a list of commands such as:

- Look: Allows to select an object from the room the player is at the moment and gives information about it.
- Go: Allows the player to select an exit from the room where it is at the moment and go to the door the exit connects to.
      To make it work, the direction of the desired room (forward, back, east and west) MUST be introduced.

- Open: Allows to open locked doors (if the player has the key) and obtain the content of a chest.
- Status: Gives info about the player's condition (HP, Armor, Weapon, etc).
- Inventory: Lists all the items the player has at the moment.
- Pick: Allows to pick an item and put it to the inventory.
- Drop: Allows to remove an item from the inventory, and place it to the room.
- Put: Allows to put an item into an other item, if possible. For example the "Figure" and the "Sack" (The figure is at the corridor room, and the sack at the stairs room)

There are rooms there there are enemies. 
The commands will be:

- Weapon: Attacks with the equipped weapon.
- Stomp: Smashes the enemy with the foot, stunning it.
- Ignore: Ignores the enemy.
- Status:  Gives info about the player's condition
- Item: Allows to use an item if possible.

The optimal path to complete the game will be:

- Go to the Exit to the cave.
- Fight the enemies.
- Pick the figure.
- Drop the figure.
- Pick the key it contains.
- Go to the Marble Portal.
- Pick the Goat (has 20 damage).
- Go to the Marble portal.
- Go to the Corner.
- Fight the enemies.
- Test the sack (if wanted).
- Go to the platform.
- Face the boss.
- Open "forward" (which is the name of the exit).
- Go forward.
- Go play videogames :)

Feel free to test anything, this path doesn't need to be follwed, but is, the fastest.

Look every room to discover new stuff!

Have fun!
